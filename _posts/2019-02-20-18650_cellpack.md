I was looking for a cheap solution to charge my lipos on the trip and found some really nice projects related to 18650 cells from old laptop batteries.
I got some used/defective notebook packs from an hardware seller and started to measure the capacities from these old cells.
For measuring i used the <b>BC-4000 EXPERT Charger</b> (<a href="https://www.amazon.de/BC-4000-EXPERT-Universal-Ladeger%C3%A4t-Generation/dp/B06XPLLM18">click</a>).

It turn out, that the most of the cells have a capacity of around 2500 mAh.
Before you can build your pack, you have to measure each cells voltage after a full charge an let them sit for around four weeks. Measure the voltage againand check if the  voltage has dropped >=0.1V. In my case i could use all cells and i have no single cell dropped so high. If the voltage drop is over 0.1 volts sort the cell out.

<b>Tip:</b>
Mark any cell with a number to identify later on and write every measured value directly on the cell.

I calculated the pack with <a href="http://repackr.com/">repackr.com</a> to have all cells in series with the same capacity.
So i ended up with 6s4p at around 10.000 mAh.
