I was looking for a cheap solution to charge my lipos on the trip and found some really nice projects related to 18650 cells from old laptop batteries.
I got some used/defective notebook packs from an hardware seller and started to measure the capacities from these old cells.
For measuring i used the <b>BC-4000 EXPERT Charger</b> (<a href="https://www.amazon.de/BC-4000-EXPERT-Universal-Ladeger%C3%A4t-Generation/dp/B06XPLLM18">click</a>).

It turn out, that the most of the cells have a capacity of around 2500 mAh.

I calculated the pack with http://repackr.com/ to have all cells in series with the same capacity.
So i ended up with 6s4p at around 10.000 mAh.
