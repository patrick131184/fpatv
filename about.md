My Name is Patrick, i am born in 1984 (don't want to update my age every year) and i live in germany.
I started building my first quad in spring 2018, learned flying in Velocidrone, Liftoff and some other sims.
My first line of sight flight ended about 10 seconds after starting. My quad jsut fell of the air (i used oneshot and forgot to calibrate the ecs's). You can watch my first FPV flight ever on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipyP1tStaLfgfkL-GJ1RfQ" target="_blank">Youtube Channel</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1hkaajxR_w" target="_blank">here</a>.
